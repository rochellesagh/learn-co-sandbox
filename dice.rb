#STEP 1
# Simulate the rolling of a die 5 times
# counter = 0 
# while counter <30

# STEP 2
#Push each roll to an array

# STEP 3
#Print out the array

# STEP 4
# Print out the total of your 5 rolls

# STEP 5
# Compare your total to the computerâ€™s total (a random number chosen from the computer_array)

# STEP 6
# Determine the winner/if it is a tie and output a message that congratulates the winner!
